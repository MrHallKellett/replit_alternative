#  **Python Challenges I**

## Input, output, variables, assignment, functions, data types.

### Hello World

1\. Write a Python program that displays the message “Hello World” to the user.

<!-- -->

	Hello World

<!-- -->

---

### Hello [newline] World

2\. Extend your program so that the words “Hello” and “World” appear on two separate lines.

<!-- -->

	Hello
	World

<!-- -->

---

### Meet and Greet

3\. Next, write the code so that the Python program asks the user to enter their name, and then greets them.

<!-- -->

	Hello, what's your name?
	Bob
	Hello Bob, it's nice to meet you.

<!-- -->

---

### Name Length

4\. Extend your program so it tells the user how many letters there are in their name.

#### // Example Run 1:

<!-- -->

	Did you know you have 3 letters in your name?

<!-- -->

#### // Example Run 2:

<!-- -->

	Did you know you have 8 letters in your name?

<!-- -->

*Note: in order for this to work you must not have broken the template code!*

### Number Adder

5\. Now extend the program so that it will add together two numbers and tell the user the answer.


<!-- -->

	Tell me a number:
	88
	And another:
	7
	I've added them together! The answer is: 95

<!-- -->

### "In X years' time..."

6\. Now, ask the user to enter their name (again) and their age. Make it so the program  does the following calculation on their age and provides this output, telling them how old they will be in X years time:

#### // Example Run 1:

<!-- -->

	Hello, who are you?
	Thomas
	How old are you?
	4
	OK, Thomas you are 4 years old.
	Did you know that in 4 years' time you will be 8 years old?

<!-- -->

#### // Example Run 2:

<!-- -->

	Hello, who are you?
	Hakeem
	How old are you?
	16
	OK, Hakeem, you are 16 years old.
	Did you know that in 16 years' time you will be 32 years old?

<!-- -->

### Name Repeater

7\. Finally, add these lines of code to the program so that it asks the user to input their first name, and then their second name. It then asks them to input a number. The program will then print out their FULL NAME however many times the person requested.

<!-- -->

	What is your first name?
	Roald
	What is your last name?
	Dahl
	How many times?
	7
	Roald Dahl Roald Dahl Roald Dahl Roald Dahl Roald Dahl Roald Dahl Roald Dahl
