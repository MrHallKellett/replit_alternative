# Python Challenges III

## Errors

---

Errors in a computer program can be classified into three categories: **syntax** errors, **runtime** errors and **logical** errors.

Syntax errors are mistakes in the programming code that conflict with the rules of the programming language and therefore prevent the program from executing. Examples of syntax errors are wrongly ordered IF/ELIF/ELSE statements (E.g. ELSE IF ELIF) or missing symbols.

Runtime errors are errors that occur during the program's execution (at _runtime_). These errors are thrown due to unexpected data. Runtime errors in Python are further categorised into different _exceptions_ e.g. ValueError, IndexError, UnboundLocalError. A typical cause of a runtime error is confusion of data types (_e.g. something is a string but it should be an integer!)._

Logical errors are in some ways the hardest type of error to debug. Logical errors do not prevent the program from executing (syntax error) and do not crash the program during its execution (runtime error). A program containing a logical error will finish its execution but will display erroneous results. It is then the programmer's job to find the source of the error.

## YOUR ASSIGNMENT:

For each task you should complete the relevant section of your "Identifying and Explaining Errors" worksheet on Google Drive as well as fixing the code on repl.it.

 1. Identify what type of error is found in the code

 2. Explain what is causing the error.

 3. Amend the code to fix the problem.

 4. Once all tasks are finished you can then run the automated tests (RUN TESTS). You may find there were other errors you did not solve.

 5. After making the final improvements to the code, make sure you update your worksheet explanations.
