## Introduction to Structured Programming

---

This assignment aims to introduce you to the idea of **structured programming**. The program has been separated into modules. Each module is its own **subroutine** that performs a specific task. The subroutines are then called when needed from the **main program**.

1\. Test the starter code. Understand how it works.

2\. Add in a 3rd option to the menu - `3. count consonants`

3\. Program the `count_consonants()` function - just follow the pattern of the `count_vowels()` function.

4\. Finish off the `count_capitals()` function - demonstrating your knowledge of the string method `.isupper()`

5\. Program one more user-defined function of choice and add it to the main menu.

**EXTENSION:**

6\. Program a feature named `count_thai()`. If you do not speak Thai then you can set the `IM_THAI` flag at the top of the page to `False` and do this instead in language of your choice.

This function should return a multiline string which is then printed to the console in the main program:

    What word to analyse?
    สถานีตำรวจ

    What to do?

    1. count vowels
    2. count capitals
    3. count consonants
    4. count Thai

    Gonna be countin' Thai

    I found 6 consonants
    I found 4 vowels
	I found 0 tone markers

7\. Include data validation in your program so it rejects invalid words. You must consider the different aspects that could make a word invalid!

    What to do?

    1. count vowels
    2. count capitals
    3. count consonants
