# replit_alternative

Some tools to help with replit's announcement that they are deprecating their Teams for Edu service.

## scrape_io_tests.py

![Demo of I/O test scraping](replit_io_tests_export.gif)

## io_test_runner.py

A work in progress - run replit I/O tests locally using `unitest.mock.patch`.
